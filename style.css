<i><h1>To my safe haven,</h1>

<p>Whenever this song plays, it feels like my heart is speaking in a language only you understand.

<p>Out of all the people in this world, you are the one I feel peaceful with. Not the kind of feeling that is loud and temporary, but the kind that stays — soft, constant, and sure. The kind of love that doesn’t fade when things get hard, doesn’t disappear when days are quiet, and doesn’t change even when time keeps moving.<p>

If life gives us libu-libong buwan, I don’t want a single one without you in it. Because you are not just part of my present — you are someone I see in my tomorrows, in my plans, in the simple dreams I keep to myself. When I think about where I want to be, who I want beside me, my heart doesn’t hesitate. It chooses you.<p>

You are my comfort after long days, my calm in the middle of overthinking, my happiness in the smallest moments. With you, love feels safe. It feels like I don’t have to pretend, don’t have to be afraid, don’t have to question where I stand.<p>
Even if the world changes, even if seasons come and go, even if time stretches far beyond what we can imagine — my heart already knows where it belongs. It belongs with you.<p>

You are not just someone I love. You are the one my heart will always come home to. 🌙💛.</p>
